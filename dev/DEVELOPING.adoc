= Developing core2

The top-level project ties all the other projects together for convenience whilst working within this repo.
All of the below commands should be run in the *root* of the core2 repo.

== Prerequisites

You will need either JDK 11 or 17 installed.

== Getting started

core2 uses https://gradle.org/[Gradle] - a JVM build tool that supports multi-module, polyglot projects.
You do not need to install Gradle to develop core2 - there is a Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[wrapper] in the repo.

* Java classes are (re-)compiled automatically when you (re-)start a REPL or run tests
* Start a REPL with `./gradlew clojureRepl`
* Once you've connected to the REPL, in the `user` namespace, run:
** `(dev)` to require and go to the `dev` namespace.
** `(go)` to start up the dev node
** `(halt)` to stop it
** `(reset)` to stop it, reload changed namespaces, and restart it
** if you're using Emacs/CIDER, `cider-ns-refresh` will do all this for you - `C-c M-n M-r`, `, s x` in Spacemacs, `, n r` in Doom.
** Conjure users can use `ConjureRefresh`, see the https://github.com/Olical/conjure#mappings[docs] for bindings
** see https://github.com/weavejester/integrant-repl[Integrant REPL] for more details.
* You should now have a running XTDB node under `dev/node` - you can verify this by calling `(xt/status node)` (in the `dev` namespace).
* Most of the time, you shouldn't need to bounce the REPL, but:
** if you add a module, or change any of the dependencies of any of the modules, that'll require a REPL bounce.
** if you change any of the Java classes, that'll require a REPL bounce
** otherwise, `(dev/reset)` (or just `(reset)` if you're already in the `dev` ns) should be sufficient.
** Please don't put any more side-effecting top-level code in dev namespaces - you'll break this reload ability and make me sad.
** To run a single test file, run (e.g.) `./gradlew test --tests 'xtdb.api_test**'`
** Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to add xtdb hooks to your local repo.

== Testing

* Test all with `./gradlew test`; `./gradlew integration-test` for longer tests
* Some tests have external dependencies which require `docker-compose`:
** `docker-compose up` (`docker-compose up <postgres|kafka>` etc for individual containers),
** `./gradlew jdbc-test` / `./gradlew kafka-test`
** `docker-compose down`

== Profiling

NOTE: TODO: adapt to Gradle

To attach YourKit:

* Install YourKit (it's on the AUR, for Arch folks)
* Add an alias to `~/.clojure/deps.edn`:
+
[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {:yourkit {:jvm-opts ["-agentpath:/opt/yourkit/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so"]}}}
----
* `clj -A:yourkit -M:repl/cider`

== Releasing core2

See link:RELEASING.adoc[].

== Arrow Fork

We maintain a fork of [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) to fix a couple of issues in `DenseUnionVector` - see [this diff](https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...juxt:master) for more details.

To upgrade Arrow:

* Usual bump in `project.clj`
* Clone the [Arrow repo](https://github.com/apache/arrow), add the [JUXT fork](https://github.com/juxt/arrow) as a remote.
* Rebase `juxt/master` on the upstream tag.
* In core2, `./bin/rebuild-forked-arrow-files.sh`
* Test
* Push (`--force-with-lease`) to JUXT fork, and commit to core2.
