= Google Cloud Storage
:page-aliases: reference::google-cloud-storage.adoc

You can use Google's Cloud Storage (GCS) as either: 

* XTDB's 'document store'
* An implementation of the XTDB query index xref:{page-component-version}@administration::checkpointing.adoc[checkpoint store].

Documents are serialized via https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy[Nippy].

In both cases, you will require a Google Cloud Project with a bucket to store the files in. See the https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets["Create Buckets" documentation] from the Google Cloud docs. 

== Authentication 

Authentication for both the document store and checkpoint store components within the module is handled via Google's "Application Default Credentials" - see the https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/README.md#application-default-credentials[relevant documentation] to get set up.

Whichever method of Authentication you use, ensure that they at least have the permissions to:

* Read objects from a bucket
* Write objects to a bucket

If using the **checkpoint store**, you will need the following permissions in addition to the above:

* List objects from a bucket
* Delete objects from a bucket

== Project Dependency

In order to use GCS within XTDB, you must first add this module as a project dependency:

[tabs]
====
deps.edn::
+
[source,clojure, subs=attributes+]
----
com.xtdb/xtdb-google-cloud-storage {:mvn/version "{xtdb_version}"}
----

pom.xml::
+
[source,xml, subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.xtdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>xtdb-google-cloud-storage</artifactId>
    <version>{xtdb_version}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

== Using GCS as a document store

Replace the implementation of the document store with `+xtdb.google.cloud-storage/->document-store+`

[tabs]
====
JSON::
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "xtdb/document-store": {
    "xtdb/module": "xtdb.google.cloud-storage/->document-store",
    "project-id": "your-project-id",
    "bucket": "your-storage-bucket",
    "prefix": "optional-containing-folder/"
  },
}
----

Clojure::
+
[source,clojure]
----
{:xtdb/document-store {:xtdb/module 'xtdb.google.cloud-storage/->document-store
                       :project-id "your-project-id",
                       :bucket "your-storage-bucket",
                       :prefix "optional-containing-folder/"}}
----

EDN::

[source,clojure]
----
{:xtdb/document-store {:xtdb/module xtdb.google.cloud-storage/->document-store
                       :project-id "your-project-id",
                       :bucket "your-storage-bucket",
                       :prefix "optional-containing-folder/"}}
----
====

== Parameters

* `project-id` (string, required) - The name of the GCP project that the bucket is contained within 
* `bucket` (string, required) - The cloud storage bucket which the documents will be stored within
* `prefix` (string, optional) - An optional prefix/folder name which will be used within document names (ie, could create a subfolder on a container called 'xtdb-document-store', and all of the document store files will be located under the folder)

[#checkpoint-store]
== Checkpoint store

GCS can be used as a query index xref:{page-component-version}@administration::checkpointing.adoc[checkpoint store].  For more advice/configuration concerning the checkpointer itself, see xref:{page-component-version}@administration::checkpointing.adoc[Checkpointing].  

[source,clojure]
----
;; under :xtdb/index-store -> :kv-store -> :checkpointer
;; see the Checkpointing guide for other parameters
{:checkpointer {...
                :store {:xtdb/module 'xtdb.google.cloud-storage/->checkpoint-store
                        :project-id "your-project-id",
                        :bucket "your-storage-bucket",
                        :prefix "optional-containing-folder/"}}
----

=== Parameters

* `project-id` (string, required) - The name of the GCP project that the bucket is contained within 
* `bucket` (string, required) - The cloud storage bucket which the checkpoints will be stored within
* `prefix` (string, optional) - An optional prefix/folder name which will be used within checkpoint names (ie, could create a subfolder on a container called 'xtdb-checkpoints', and all of the checkpoint files will be located under the folder)
