= HTTP Health Server
:page-aliases: reference::http.adoc

This document explains how to configure the XTDB HTTP Health Server module.

Production XTDB nodes often run in containers deployed on infrastructures where automation matters: nodes are "managed" by components in charge of tasks such as monitoring resources and routing traffic. Examples of such infrastructure include (but are not limited to) link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] and link:https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[AWS ECS]. In all cases the supervising component has the need to assess the health of the XTDB nodes it supervises. 

The XTDB Health Check module aims at facilitating this task by allowing some important states of a running node that uses it to be observable. It achieves this by first collecting `events` published by the node as it transits through its various states; then making them available via a tiny http server it runs. 

Rather than a health-check service directly usable by e.g. by K8S, it provides informations usable when configuring liveness, readiness and startup probes, with the intent to cope with the case of a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-startup-probes[slow starting container] e.g., when upon starting the node recovers its index-store from a large checkpoint.

== Structure of an event
[source.clojure]
----
{:event "end-restore",
 :thread "nREPL-session-8139ad0e-476e-455e-9579-810d6d4e5f06",
 :clock 10.406734083,
 :event-type "healthz",
 :timestamp "2023-02-10T06:16:33.190Z",
 :namespace "xtdb.checkpoint"}
----
The `:clock` attribute is a number of seconds (accurate to the nanosecond) and reasonably monotonic.  

// TODO finish this write-up once I've sorted the event question.

== HTTP routes served
.Currently the HTTP Health Check module serves the following routes:
* `/healthz`
- returns the latest events of each namespace
* `/healthz/hist`
- returns the full history (as an ordered vector)
* `/healthz/ns/:ns`
- returns the full history for namespace `:ns`

== Events currently collected

.Currently the module collects the following events:
* `xtdb.node/node-starting`
* `xtdb.node/slow-closing`
* `xtdb.node/slow-query`
* `xtdb.checkpoint/begin-checkpoint`, `xtdb.checkpoint/end-checkpoint`
* `xtdb.checkpoint/begin-restore`, `xtdb.checkpoint/end-restore`
* `xtdb.tx/begin-tx-ingester`
* `xtdb.query/failed-query`


[#start-http-health-check]
== Starting the HTTP Health Check server

=== Project Dependency

[source,clojure, subs=attributes+]
----
com.xtdb/xtdb-http-health-check {:mvn/version "{xtdb_version}"}
----

You can start up a Jetty HTTP/HTTP2 server on a node by including `xtdb.http-health-check/server` in your node configuration, optionally passing the server port:

[tabs]
====
JSON::
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "xtdb.http-health-check/server": {
    "port": 8080,  
    ...
  }
}
----

Clojure::
+
[source,clojure]
----
{:xtdb.http-health-check/server 
    {:port 8080
     ...}}
----

EDN::

[source,clojure]
----
{:xtdb.http-health-check/server 
    {:port 8080
     ...}}
----

// TODO Authorization section

=== Parameters

* `port` (int, default 7000)
* `jetty-opts` (map): further options to pass to the https://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.adapter.jetty.html[Ring Jetty adapter]

=== Ring Handler (TODO)

XTDB also exposes a https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] handler that you can include within your own Ring-compatible server, with parameters as above:

[source,clojure]
----
(xtdb.http-health-check/->xtdb-handler xtdb-node {...})
