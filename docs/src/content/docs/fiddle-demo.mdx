import Fiddle from '@components/fiddle.astro';
import Txs from '@components/fiddle/txs.astro';
import Query from '@components/fiddle/query.astro';

## Basic Usage

You can add a `Fiddle` to the page with pre-set transactions & query like so:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, foo) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM docs" />
</Fiddle>

If you want to preserve whitespace you can do this:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, foo) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query q={
`SELECT docs.xt$id, docs.foo
  FROM docs
-- You can also put comments :)`}
/>
</Fiddle>


## Hide editors

Sometimes you just want to show of the query, you can hide the transactions like so:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs hidden={true}
       txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, foo) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM docs" />
</Fiddle>


You can do the same with the query of course:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, foo) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query hidden={true} q="SELECT * FROM docs"/>
</Fiddle>

If you have an error in the transactions/query it looks like this:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, foo) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FOM docs" />
</Fiddle>

## System Time

You can set system time on a transaction like so:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs systemTime="2020-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM xt$txs" />
</Fiddle>

## Multiple Transactions

It can be useful to include multiple "batches" of transactions.
Particularly for showing of valid time & system time:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs systemTime="2020-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Txs systemTime="2020-01-02"
       txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'two');" />
  <Query q={
`SELECT d.xt$id, d.name, d.xt$system_from
  FROM docs FOR ALL VALID_TIME AS d
  ORDER BY d.xt$id, d.xt$system_from`} />
</Fiddle>

## Magic Context

While of course you can use hidden `Txs` to include transactions previously executed on the page but that can get tedious.

Instead you can tell the component to look at transactions from *previous* fiddles on the page.
Note that it will only look for transactions from fiddles with the *same context id string* set.

For example:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2020-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'one');" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM docs" />
</Fiddle>

Note that it we only have docs from this fiddle.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2020-01-02"
       txs="
    INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'two');
    INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (2, 'three');" />
  <Query q={
`SELECT d.xt$id, d.name, d.xt$system_from
  FROM docs FOR ALL VALID_TIME AS d
  ORDER BY d.xt$id, d.xt$system_from`} />
</Fiddle>

Note that now we have the transactions from the previous fiddle :)

This fiddle uses a different context id, so it will not use the context of previous fiddles:

<Fiddle magicContext="different-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2020-01-02"
       txs="
    INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'two');
    INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (2, 'three');" />
  <Query q={
`SELECT d.xt$id, d.name, d.xt$system_from
  FROM docs FOR ALL VALID_TIME AS d
  ORDER BY d.xt$id, d.xt$system_from`} />
</Fiddle>


## Caveats

Please note that the fiddle expects **exactly one** `Query` and it will always run it **after all transactions are run**
For example:

<Fiddle>
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'one')" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM docs" />
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (2, 'two')" />
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM docs" />
</Fiddle>

And with no query you'll get an error at load time in the browser console.

<Fiddle>
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO docs (xt$id, name) VALUES (2, 'two')" />
</Fiddle>

Having just a query is fine though (and useful with Magic Context):

<Fiddle>
  <Query q="SELECT * FROM docs" />
</Fiddle>
