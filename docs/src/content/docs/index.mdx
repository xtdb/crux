XTDB is an immutable SQL database that reduces the time and cost of building and maintaining safe systems of record. You can read more about our mission [here](/intro/why-xtdb).

In XTDB there's no need for handcrafted "audit tables", or bespoke versioning and filtering logic - just write regular looking SQL and history will be preserved (but accessible whenever you need it!):

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-01"
       txs="INSERT INTO product (_id, name, price) VALUES
            (1, 'An Electric Bicycle', 400)" />
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-05"
       txs="UPDATE product SET price = 405 WHERE _id = 1" />
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-10"
       txs="UPDATE product SET price = 350 WHERE _id = 1" />
  <Query q={`SELECT *, _valid_from
FROM product
  FOR VALID_TIME ALL -- i.e. "show me all versions"
  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-31' -- "...as observed at month end"`} />
</Fiddle>

Unlike regular SQL databases, XTDB retains all history by default and helps businesses to easily and accurately report: _**‚ÄúHere is the complete history of my data, as I understood it previously, and as I understand it currently.‚Äù**_

XTDB builds upon the 'bitemporal' capabilities defined within [SQL:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011) but makes those capabilities both ubiquitous and automatic, without imposing any unnecessary complications on the application schema.
