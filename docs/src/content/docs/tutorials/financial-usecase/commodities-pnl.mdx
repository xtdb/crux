Let's imagine you're a commodities trader.

Every day you arrive at your desk and look at your Risk and PnL reports, telling you the value and risk of your trading positions.

Whenever something in those reports doesn't look quite like what you were expecting you have to do some counterfactual exploration of all the various inputs to understand what's happened.

For example, let's assume that over the course of the day your colleagues have made the following trades:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_trades
(xt$id, symbol, quantity, price, xt$valid_from, trader_name)
VALUES
(1, 'XAU:CUR', 100, 1800.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 10:00:00', 'John Doe'),   -- Gold
(2, 'XAG:CUR', 500, 25.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 11:00:00', 'Jane Smith'),   -- Silver
(3, 'CL1:COM', 300, 60.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 11:30:00', 'Mike Johnson'), -- Crude Oil
(4, 'NG1:COM', 400, 3.10, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 12:45:00', 'Emily White'),   -- Natural Gas
(5, 'W1:COM', 250, 5.20, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 13:05:00', 'Alex Green')      -- Wheat
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT t.*, t.xt$valid_from
FROM commodity_trades as t
ORDER BY t.xt$id
`} />
</Fiddle>

At the end of the day, the market closes with the following prices:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_spot_prices
(xt$id, spot_price, xt$valid_from)
VALUES
('XAU:CUR', 1805.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('XAG:CUR', 25.35, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('CL1:COM', 61.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('NG1:COM', 3.15, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00'),
('W1:COM', 5.25, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT p.xt$id, p.spot_price, p.xt$valid_from
FROM commodity_spot_prices as p
`} />
</Fiddle>

Now we want to price our risk and PnL for the end of this week.
Let's extract the information we need to calculate our PnL:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    ct.xt$id as trade_id,
    ct.symbol,
    ct.quantity,
    ct.price as trade_price,
    csp.spot_price,
    ct.xt$valid_from as trade_timestamp,
    ct.trader_name,
    csp.xt$valid_from as spot_price_timestamp
FROM
    commodity_trades ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp.xt$id
`} />
</Fiddle>

For the purposes of this simple example, we'll just use SQL to calculate the PnL.
However, in the 'real world', we'd usually have much more complex objects (yield curves, etc.) and would use a quant pricing library.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    SUM((csp.spot_price - ct.price) * ct.quantity) as pnl
FROM
    commodity_trades ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp.xt$id
`} />
</Fiddle>

So far so good.

On the Monday morning, after a pleasant weekend's break, you come back into the trading floor.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_trades (xt$id, symbol, quantity, price, xt$valid_from, trader_name)
VALUES
(6, 'XAU:CUR', 1000, 2590.40, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 10:00:00', 'John Doe'),
(7, 'XAG:CUR', 30, 27.30, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 11:00:00', 'Jane Smith')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT t.*, t.xt$valid_from
FROM commodity_trades as t
ORDER BY t.xt$id
`} />
</Fiddle>

At the end of this Monday trading day, the market closes with the following prices:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-04-01"
       txs={`
INSERT INTO commodity_spot_prices (xt$id, spot_price, xt$valid_from)
VALUES
('XAU:CUR', 2010.50, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('XAG:CUR', 25.25, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('CL1:COM', 62.00, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('NG1:COM', 3.17, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00'),
('W1:COM', 5.27, TIMESTAMP '2024-03-11 17:00:00')
`} />
  <Query q={`
SELECT p.xt$id, p.spot_price, p.xt$valid_from
FROM commodity_spot_prices as p
`} />
</Fiddle>

We now recalculate our new PnL:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    SUM((csp.spot_price - ct.price) * ct.quantity) as pnl
FROM
    commodity_trades ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp.xt$id
`} />
</Fiddle>

Oh no!

What if we could ignore the today's trades, and just see what our closing position on Friday would have looked like in the market at the end of today.

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q={`
SELECT
    SUM((csp.spot_price - ct.price) * ct.quantity) as pnl
FROM
    commodity_trades FOR VALID_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-03-08 17:00:00' ct
INNER JOIN
    commodity_spot_prices csp
ON
    ct.symbol = csp.xt$id
`} />
</Fiddle>

We have now established that today's trades must be causing the dramatic PnL change.

## Reasoning about cross-effects in high dimensions

In the abstract, traders need to be able to reason about situations quickly and hedge against unexpected situations.

Navigating the relationships between portfolio positions and price volatilities ([the Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))) is generally only possible with the aid of sophisticated pricing and risk models.
For institutions with large portfolios, distributed teams and complex positions, equipping individual traders with the tools to understand the dynamics surrounding their own trades is essential.

With ubiquitous as-of querying, XTDB provides an essential mechanism to validate the impacts of different dimensions of change as applied to subsets of a portfolio, and without the need for snapshots or other expensive operations.

This general approach to the problem of financial risk was pioneered by SecDB in the 1990s and has been repeated across many subsequent systems.
