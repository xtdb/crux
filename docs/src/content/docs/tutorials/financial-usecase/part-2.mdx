A typical trade flow will include the following steps:

1. A trade is booked on a certain day at a certain time
2. Later that same day, the trade is entered into a risk system

Whenever a trade arrives in our risk system we can set the valid-time (the business curated timeline) to the exact time of the trade. This backfilling of histoical data allows us to understand and report on the risk position of our trade portfolio as-of any point in the past.

For example, a set of trades entering our risk system may look something like this:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-15"
       txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, symbol, volume, xt$valid_from)
            VALUES
            (1, 'ABC', 150, TIMESTAMP '2024-01-15 10:00:00'),
            (2, 'XYZ', 430, TIMESTAMP '2024-01-15 11:15:00'),
            (3, 'ABC', 200, TIMESTAMP '2024-01-15 12:05:00')" />
  <Query q="SELECT t.*, t.xt$valid_from AS trade_date
            FROM trades AS t
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

However sometimes a trade is booked right at the end of the day, after the standard End-of-Day reporting window has closed, and therefore isn't available and processed by the system until sometime later.

Let's say this trade was entered the next day:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs systemTime="2024-01-16"
       txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, symbol, volume, xt$valid_from)
            VALUES
            (4, 'DEF', 320, TIMESTAMP '2024-01-15 19:10:00')" />
  <Query q="SELECT t.*, t.xt$valid_from AS trade_date
            FROM trades AS t
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

We can re-run our final risk reports for yesterday to include the late-arriving trade:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades FOR ALL VALID_TIME AS t
            WHERE t.VALID_TIME CONTAINS TIMESTAMP '2024-01-15 23:59:59'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Now our reports can be made consistent and reproducible whilst accounting for late-arriving data, great!

Can anyone see any potential problems with updating the past like this?

Let's say instead of backfilling a trade to yesterday, someone adds a trade a *month* ago!

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Txs txs="INSERT INTO trades (xt$id, symbol, volume, xt$valid_from)
            VALUES
            (5, 'GHI', 1000000, DATE '2023-12-01')" />
  <Query q="SELECT t.*, t.xt$valid_from AS trade_date
            FROM trades AS t
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Now when the auditors come in, they check for changes since they last were here:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$valid_from > DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

They can't find the trade we sneaked into last month! Has someone just gotten away with fraud?

If we want to allow editing the timeline, how can we avoid this?

In XTDB we use system-time (a.k.a. wall-clock time), an **immutable** timeline that gets appended to with every change. This means our fraudulent/malicious/accidental edit from earlier gets caught easily:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT *
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE t.xt$system_from > DATE '2024-01-01'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

In fact we can even scan the system for suspicious or unusual changes. For example, any retroactive changes to valid-time that go back further than 24 hours:

<Fiddle magicContext="my-context">
  <Query q="SELECT t.*, t.xt$system_from, t.xt$valid_from
            FROM trades AS t
            WHERE (t.xt$system_from - t.xt$valid_from) > DURATION 'PT24H'
            ORDER BY t.xt$id" />
</Fiddle>

Conclusion: As an immutable database, XTDB keeps you safe from your own changes by making sure to record when they happened. Even when reaching into the past!
