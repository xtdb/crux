title: Getting started
---

XTDB can run in-process (in a JVM), or through traditional client-server connections.

== Client/Server

You can start an XTDB server using the 'standalone' Docker image:

[source,shell]
----
docker pull ghcr.io/xtdb/xtdb-standalone-ea

docker run -tip 3000:3000 ghcr.io/xtdb/xtdb-standalone-ea
----

This starts a server on http://localhost:3000.
By default, your data will be saved in a local directory in the Docker image, but you can also attach a host volume in the usual Docker way, to preserve your data on your host machine:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -tip 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/host/dir:/var/lib/xtdb \
  ghcr.io/xtdb/xtdb-standalone-ea
----

=== Connecting through HTTP

You can then connect to your XTDB server using cURL, or similar tools.
For example, to check its status:

[source,shell]
----
curl http://localhost:3000/status
----

From here, check out the link:/sdks/openapi/index.html[OpenAPI docs] to see what else is available.

=== Connecting from Clojure

NOTE: other client libraries coming soon!

If you're using Clojure, you can use the Clojure client library to connect to this node.

First, add the thin client to your `deps.edn`, or dependency manager of choice:

[source,clojure]
----
;; deps.edn

{:mvn/repos {"ossrh-snapshots" {:url "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"}}

 :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}
        com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-api {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}
        com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-http-client-clj {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}}}
----

Once you have a REPL (e.g. by running `clj`), you can connect to the XTDB node with:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.client :as xtc]
         '[xtdb.api :as xt])

(with-open [node (xtc/start-client "http://localhost:3000")]
  (xt/status node)

  ;; ...
  )
----

From here, check out the link:/sdks/clojure/index.html[Clojure API docs] to submit data and run queries.

== In process (JVM/Clojure)

If you're running a JVM, you can also use XTDB directly, in-process.
In-process XTDB is particularly useful for testing and interactive development - you can start an in-memory node quickly and with little hassle, which makes it a great tool for unit tests and REPL experimentation.

NOTE: This part of the guide uses Clojure - support for Java and other JVM languages is coming soon!

First, ensure you are running JDK 17+ and then add the XTDB dependencies to your `deps.edn`:

.deps.edn
[source,clojure]
----

{:mvn/repos {"ossrh-snapshots" {:url "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"}}

 :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}
        com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-api {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}
        com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-core {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}}

 :aliases {:xtdb {:jvm-opts ["--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED"
                             "-Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true"]}}}
----

Once you have a REPL (started with `clj -A:xtdb`), you can create an in-memory XTDB node with:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.node :as xtn]
         '[xtdb.api :as xt])

(with-open [node (xtn/start-node {})]
  (xt/status node)

  ;; ...
  )
----

This node uses exactly the same API as the thin client - so, again, from here, check out the link:/sdks/clojure/index.html[Clojure API docs] to submit data and run queries.
