XTDB supports two query languages: link:../reference/main/sql/queries.html[SQL], and link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html[XTQL] - our new data-oriented, cross-platform, composable query language inspired by Datalog and relational algebra.
XTQL can be written in JSON, Java/Scala/Kotlin (full DSL coming soon) and Clojure's EDN.

XTQL queries are structured pipeline of operations - e.g. scanning a table, joining multiple tables/queries, grouping/aggregations and sorting/limiting.

Let's walk through a brief introduction to XTQL:

== Basic operations

* To read a table, we use link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from[`from`].
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=bo-xtql-1,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=bo-json-1,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=bo-sql-1,indent=0]
----
+
* We can look up a single user-id by binding it in the link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from[`from`] clause:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=bo-xtql-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=bo-json-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=bo-sql-2,indent=0]
----
+
* link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from[`from`] is a valid query in isolation but, for anything more powerful, we'll need a 'pipeline':
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=bo-xtql-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=bo-json-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=bo-sql-3,indent=0]
----

XTQL operations are independently composable - unlike SQL/EDN Datalog, for example, you don't need a whole 'SELECT, FROM, WHERE'/`{:find ..., :where ...}` frame every time.

== Joins

Joins in XTQL are achieved using link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#unify_explanation[Datalog-style unification]:

* Within a link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify[`unify`], we use 'logic variables' (e.g. `user-id`, `first-name` etc in the above example) to specify how the inputs should be joined together.
+
In this case, we re-use the `user-id` logic variable to indicate that the `:xt/id` from the `:users` table should be matched with the `:author-id` of the `:articles` table.
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=joins-xtql-1,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-json-1,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-sql-1,indent=0]
----

+
* For non-equality cases, we can use a link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_where[`where`] clause (where we have a full SQL-inspired expression standard library at our disposal)
+
[source,clojure]
----
;; 'find me all the users who are the same age'
include::{test}[tags=joins-xtql-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-json-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-sql-2,indent=0]
----
+
* We can specify that a certain match is optional using link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_joins[`left-join`]:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=joins-xtql-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-json-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-sql-3,indent=0]
----
+
Here, we're asking to additionally return customers who haven't yet any orders (for which the order-table columns will be absent in the results).
* Or, we can specify that we only want to return customers who _don't_ have any orders, using link:../reference/main/stdlib/predicates.html#_boolean_functions[`not`] link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_subqueries[`exists?`]:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=joins-xtql-4,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-json-4,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=joins-sql-4,indent=0]
----
+
(naturally, `IN` is also available, but uses link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_subqueries[`exists?`] instead)

== Projections

* We can create new columns from old ones using link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_with[`with`]:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=proj-xtql-1,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=proj-json-1,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=proj-sql-1,indent=0]
----
+
We can also use link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_with[`with`] within link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify[`unify`] - this creates new logic variables which we can then unify in the same way.
+
* Where link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_with[`with`] adds to the available columns, link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_return[`return`] only yields the specified columns to the next operation:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=proj-xtql-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=proj-json-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=proj-sql-2,indent=0]
----
* Where we don't need any additional projections, we can use link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_without[`without`]:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=proj-xtql-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=proj-json-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=proj-sql-3,indent=0]
----

== Aggregations

To count/sum/average values, we use link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_aggregate[`aggregate`]:

[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=aggr-xtql-1,indent=0]
----

[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=aggr-json-1,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=aggr-sql-1,indent=0]
----

== 'Pull'

When we've found the documents we're interested in, it's common to then want a tree of related information.
For example, if a user is reading an article, we might also want to show them details about the author as well as any comments.

(Users of existing EDN Datalog databases may already be familiar with link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_subqueries['pull'] - in XTQL, because subqueries are a first-class concept, we rely on extensively on these to express a more powerful/composable behaviour.)

[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=pull-xtql-1,indent=0]

;; => [{:title "...", :content "...",
;;      :author {:first-name "...", :last-name "..."}
;;      :comments [{:comment "...", :name "..."}, ...]}]

;; SQL?
;; Yeah, so, erm, 'left as an exercise to the reader'? ðŸ˜…
;; Lots of nested left-joins, array-aggs, and vendor-specific JSON functions required there to guarantee this same output.
----

[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=pull-json-1,indent=0]
----

In this example, we use link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_subqueries[`pull`] to pull back a single map - we know that there's only one author per article (in our system).
When it's a one-to-many relationship, we use link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_subqueries[`pull*`] - this returns any matches in a vector.

Also note that, because we have the full power of subqueries, we can express requirements like 'only get me the most recent 10 comments' using ordinary query operations, without any support within link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_subqueries[`pull`] itself.

== Bitemporality

It wouldn't be XTDB without bitemporality, of course - indeed, some may be wondering how I've gotten this far without mentioning it!

(I'll assume you're roughly familiar with bitemporality for this section.
 If not, forgive me - we'll follow this up with more XTDB 2.x bitemporality content soon!)

* In XTDB 1.x, queries had to be 'point-in-time' - you had to pick a single valid/transaction time for the whole query.
+
In XTQL, while there are sensible defaults set for the whole query, you can override this on a per-link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from[`from`] basis by wrapping the table name in a vector and providing temporal parameters:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=bitemp-xtql-1,indent=0]

include::{test}[tags=bitemp-xtql-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=bitemp-json-1,indent=0]

include::{example}[tags=bitemp-json-2,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=bitemp-sql-1,indent=0]

include::{example}[tags=bitemp-sql-2,indent=0]
----
+
** You can also specify `(from <time>)`, `(to <time>)` or `(in <from-time> <to-time>)`, to give fine-grained, in-query control over the history returned for the given rows.
** System time (formerly 'transaction time', renamed for consistency with SQL:2011) is filtered in the same map with `:for-system-time`.
* This means that you can (for example) query the same table at two points-in-time in the same query - 'who worked here in both 2018 and 2023':
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=bitemp-xtql-3,indent=0]
----
+
[source,json]
----
include::{example}[tags=bitemp-json-3,indent=0]
----

== DML

XTQL can also be used to write to XTDB using XTQL DML.

It uses the same query language as above, with a small wrapper for each of the operations.
We're hoping that a reasonable proportion of use-cases that previously required transaction functions to be installed and invoked can now submit DML operations instead.

=== Insert

We submit link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#_insert_into[`insert-into`] operations to link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html[`xt/submit-tx`].
link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#_insert_into[`insert-into`] accepts a query that inserts every result into the given table:

[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Insert-xtql,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
-- we omit the submission boilerplate in the SQL equivalents

include::{example}[tags=DML-Insert-sql,indent=0]
----

Here we're preserving the valid-from and valid-to of the rows we're copying, but we could just as easily specify/calculate a different value.
Naturally, substitute your query of choice from above for the link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from[`from`] (link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify[`unify`], for example) for an arbitrarily powerful XTQL command.

(As in XT2 SQL, XTQL link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#_insert_into[`insert-into`] behaves more like an upsert - if a document with that `xt/id` already exists, it will be overwritten for the specified period of valid-time.)

=== Delete

We can delete documents using queries as well.

* For example, to delete all of the comments on a given post, we can submit the following XTQL:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Delete-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Delete-sql,indent=0]
----
+
Here, we're passing a dynamic parameter to specify the post to delete.
+
* link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#[`delete-from`] can also take a collection of extra link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify[`unify`] clauses.
Let's say instead we wanted to delete all comments on posts by a certain author - we can do that as follows:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Delete-additional-unify-clauses-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Delete-additional-unify-clauses-sql,indent=0]
----
+
Additional clauses passed to link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#[`delete-from`] in this way are unified, in the same way variables within a link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify[`unify`] are.
In this case, because we've re-used the `pid` logic variable, XT implicitly joins the two values - the `post-id` from the `comments` table with the `xt/id` on the `posts` table.
* We can specify a valid-time range to delete using `for-valid-time`, in a similar manner to the link:../reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_from[`from`] clause.
+
For example, if we want to take down all Christmas promotions on the 26th December (but we don't want to be in the office to actually delete them), we could run the following:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Delete-bitemporal-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Delete-bitemporal-sql,indent=0]
----
+
* Finally, we can delete every entry in a table by omitting any `:bind` predicates:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Delete-everything-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Delete-everything-sql,indent=0]
----

=== Update

* Update operations are almost exactly the same as deletes, except - well, they update the document rather than deleting it, obviously - but they additionally take a `set` clause.
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Update-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Update-sql,indent=0]
----
+
* Like deletes, updates also accept `:for-valid-time` and extra sub-queries to join from.
You can, for example, copy a value from another related table, or even update a denormalised value:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Update-bitemporal-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Update-bitemporal-sql-1,indent=0]

include::{example}[tags=DML-Update-bitemporal-sql-2,indent=0]
----

This is the operation that we envisage replacing a lot of XT1 transaction functions - it makes it trivial to patch a single value within a document, for example.

=== Erase

We can irretrievably erase a document using an link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#_erase_from[`erase`] query.

* Erases also look the same as deletes, but these don't support `:for-valid-time`:
+
[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Erase-xtql,indent=0]
----
+
[source,sql]
----
include::{example}[tags=DML-Erase-sql,indent=0]
----

=== Assert

link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#asserts[`assert-exists`] and link:../reference/main/xtql/txs.html#asserts[`assert-not-exists`] can be used to assert the state of the database during a transaction.
If an assertion fails, the whole transaction rolls back.
This can be used to check pre-conditions, for example.

This query asserts that no user has the email `james@example.com` before inserting a user that does:

[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Assert-xtql,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
-- not implemented yet
include::{example}[tags=DML-Assert-sql,indent=0]
----

You can check the `:xt/txs` table to see whether and why a transaction failed:

[source,clojure]
----
include::{test}[tags=DML-Assert-query,indent=0]

;; =>

include::{test}[tags=DML-Assert-query-result,indent=0]
----


Those familiar with XT1 might recognise this as `::xt/match` - albeit more powerful because you have the full query language available rather than just matching a whole document.
