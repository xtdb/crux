title: Monitoring XTDB with Grafana
---

XTDB provides tools and templates to facilitate the monitoring and observability of XTDB nodes. Metrics are exposed in the **Prometheus** format, which can be scraped by **Prometheus** and visualized in **Grafana** using XTDB's pre-built dashboards.

NOTE: The XTDB cloud images come pre-configured with Prometheus metrics exposed - see the link:../config/monitoring["Monitoring docs"^] for more information.

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* A running Grafana instance
* Prometheus configured to scrape metrics from XTDB nodes
* Prometheus configured as a data source in Grafana

Refer to the official documentation for setup instructions:

* https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/[Grafana^]
* https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/[Prometheus^]
* https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/#using[Adding Prometheus as a Grafana datasource^]

== Setting Up Grafana Dashboards

To import XTDB's pre-built dashboards:

1. In Grafana, navigate to `Dashboards -> New -> Import dashboard`.
2. Upload the dashboard JSON file from the XTDB repository.
3. Select the Prometheus data source and click `Import`.

The following dashboards are available:

=== Cluster Monitoring Dashboard

Provides an overview of the entire XTDB cluster, including node health and performance.

=== Node Debugging Dashboard

Focuses on individual XTDB nodes, showing metrics such as resource usage, performance, and health.
