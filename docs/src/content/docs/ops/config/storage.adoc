title: Storage
---

One of the key components of an XTDB node is the storage module - used to store the data and indexes that make up the database.

We offer the following implementations of the storage module:

** <<In memory>>: transient in-memory storage.
** <<Local disk>>: storage persisted to the local filesystem.
** <<Remote>>: storage persisted remotely.

[#in-memory]
== In memory

By default, the storage module is configured to use transient, in-memory storage. 

[source,yaml]
----
# default, no need to explicitly specify
# storage: !InMemory
----

[#local-disk]
== Local disk

A persistent storage implementation that writes to a local directory, also maintaining an in-memory cache of the working set. 

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Local
  # -- required

  # The path to the local directory to persist the data to.
  # (Can be set as an !Env value)
  path: /var/lib/xtdb/storage

  # -- optional

  # The maximum number of entries to store in the in-memory cache.
  # maxCacheEntries: 1024

  # The maximum number of bytes to store in the in-memory cache.
  # maxCacheBytes: 536870912
----

[#remote]
== Remote

A persistent storage implementation that:

* Persists data remotely to a provided, cloud based object store.
* Maintains an local-disk cache and in-memory cache of the working set.

NOTE: When using a remote storage implementation as part of a distributed cluster of XTDB nodes, we **must** ensure that all nodes are able to efficiently communicate the stream of file changes they make to the remote storage. We achieve this inter-node messaging using a link:tx-log#Remote[**remote transaction log**] implementation.

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  # -- required

  # Configuration of the Object Store to use for remote storage
  # Each of these is configured separately - see below for more information.
  objectStore: <ObjectStoreImplementation>

  # Local directory to store the working-set cache in.
  # (Can be set as an !Env value)
  localDiskCache: /var/lib/xtdb/remote-cache

  ## -- optional

  # The maximum number of entries to store in the in-memory cache.
  # maxCacheEntries: 1024

  # The maximum number of bytes to store in the in-memory cache.
  # maxCacheBytes: 536870912

  # The max percentage of space to use on the filesystem for the localDiskCache directory (overriden by maxDiskCacheBytes, if set).
  # maxDiskCachePercentage: 75

  # The upper limit of bytes that can be stored within the localDiskCache directory (unset by default).
  # maxDiskCacheBytes: 107374182400
