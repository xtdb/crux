title: Transaction Log
---
One of the key components of an XTDB node is the transaction log - this is a totally ordered log of all transaction operations that have been applied to the database, generally persistent & shared between nodes.

== Implementations

We offer a number of separate implementations of the transaction log, currently:

* Single-node log implementations, within `xtdb-core`:
** <<In memory>>: transient in-memory log.
** <<Local disk>>: log using the local filesystem.
* <<Remote>>: multi-node log implementations using a remote service.

== In memory

By default, the transaction log is a transient, in-memory log:

[source,yaml]
----
# default, no need to explicitly specify
# log: !InMemory
----

If configured as an in-process node, you can also specify an https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/InstantSource.html[InstantSource] implementation - this is used to override the local machine's clock when providing a system-time timestamp for each transaction.

== Local disk

A single-node persistent transaction log implementation that writes to a local directory.

[source,yaml]
----
log: !Local
  # -- required

  # The path to the local directory to store the transaction log in.
  # (Can be set as an !Env value)
  path: /var/lib/xtdb/log

  # -- optional

  # The number of entries of the buffer to use when writing to the transaction log.
  # bufferSize: 4096

  # The duration to sleep for when polling for new transactions written to the transaction log.
  # pollSleepDuration: PT0.1S

If configured as an in-process node, you can also specify an https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/InstantSource.html[InstantSource] implementation - this is used to override the local machine's clock when providing a system-time timestamp for each transaction.

== Remote

A multi-node persistent transaction log implementation that uses a remote service to store both the transaction log itself, and other shared information between the nodes such as file change notifications from the link:storage[storage module].

We currently offer the following remote transaction log implementations, available in their own modules:

* link:tx-log/kafka[Kafka]: a log implementation that uses Apache Kafka topics to store the transaction log and file change notifications.
