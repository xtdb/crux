title: Monitoring & Observability
---

XTDB offers a suite of tools & templates to facilitate monitoring and observability. 
These include a **Healthz Server** for health checks, **Metrics** for performance insights, integrations with third-party monitoring systems and **Grafana** dashboards for visualizing the health and performance of XTDB nodes.

== Healthz Server

The Healthz Server is a lightweight HTTP server that runs by default on all XTDB nodes. 
It provides health indicators, making it useful for monitoring in containerized and orchestrated environments.

=== Configuration

The Healthz Server can be configured to run on a custom port:

[source,yaml]
----
healthz:
  # Port to run the Healthz Server on.
  # Default: 8080 (can be set as an !Env value).
  port: 8080
----

=== Health Routes

The following routes are exposed by the Healthz Server and can be used to monitor the node's status:

* `/healthz/started`: Indicates whether the node has completed startup and has caught up on indexing.
  ** Recommended for https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#startup-probe[**startup probes**^].
  ** We recommend configuring a generous initial timeout, as it waits for indexing to stabilize.

* `/healthz/alive`: Confirms the application is running without critical errors.
  ** Suitable for https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#liveness-probe[**liveness probes**^].

* `/healthz/ready`: Signals that the node is ready to process requests.
  ** Suitable for https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#readiness-probe[**readiness probes**^].

== Metrics

XTDB provides various metrics for monitoring the health and performance of its nodes. 
These metrics are available via Prometheus and can also be integrated with cloud-based observability services.

=== Prometheus Metrics

By default, XTDB nodes expose metrics in the https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus^] format. 
These can be accessed at the following endpoint on the **Healthz Server**:

```
<node_url>:<healthz_port>/metrics
```

=== Cloud Integrations

XTDB nodes can be configured to report metrics to the following cloud-based monitoring services:

* link:../azure#monitoring[Azure Application Insights^]
* link:../aws#monitoring[AWS CloudWatch^]

== Grafana Dashboards

XTDB provides https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/tree/main/monitoring/grafana/dashboards[pre-built Grafana dashboards^] for monitoring the health and performance of XTDB clusters and individual nodes.

For more information on how to set these up on Grafana, see the link:../guides/monitoring-with-grafana["Monitoring XTDB with Grafana"^] guide.
