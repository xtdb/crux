title: Azure
---

XTDB provides modular support for Azure environments, including a prebuilt Docker image, integrations with **Azure Blob Storage**, **Application Insights monitoring** and configuration options for deploying onto Azure infrastructure.

NOTE: For more details on getting started with Azure, see the link:guides/starting-with-azure["Getting Started with Azure"^] guide.

== Required infrastructure

In order to run an Azure based XTDB cluster, the following infrastructure is required:

* An **Azure Storage Account**, containing a **Storage Account Container**.
* A **User Assigned Managed Identity** for authentication with Azure services.
* A **Kafka cluster** for transaction logs.
** For more information on setting up Kafka for usage with XTDB, see the link:config/tx-log/kafka[Kafka configuration^] docs.
* XTDB nodes configured to communicate with the Kafka cluster and Azure Storage Account/Container.
* (On Kubernetes) A **Federated Identity Credential** setup for the desired Kubernetes Namespace/Service account to give access to the **User Assigned Managed Identity**.

'''

[#terraform]
== Terraform Templates

To set up a basic version of the required infrastructure, we provide a set of Terraform templates specifically designed for Azure.

These can be fetched from the XTDB repository using the following command:

```bash
terraform init -from-module github.com/xtdb/xtdb.git//azure/terraform
```

=== Resources

By default, running the templates will deploy the following infrastructure:

* **XTDB Resource Group and User Assigned Managed Identity**
* **Azure Storage Account**  (with a container for object storage)
** Configured with associated resources using the link:https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-storage-storageaccount/azurerm/latest[**Azure/avm-res-storage-storageaccount**^] Terraform module.
** Adds required permissions to the User Assigned Managed Identity.
* **AKS Cluster**
** Configured with associated resources using the link:https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/aks/azurerm/latest[**Azure/aks**^] Terraform module.
* **Federated Identity Credential**
** Configures the AKS cluster to access the Azure Storage Account.
** The credential is set up for the `kubernetes_service_account_name` within the `kubernetes_namespace`, both of which are defined in the `terraform.tfvars` file.

=== Configuration

In order to customize the deployment, we provide a number of pre-defined variables within the `terraform.tfvars` file.
These variables can be modified to tailor the infrastructure to your specific needs.

For more advanced usage, the Terraform templates themselves can be modified to suit your specific requirements.

'''

[#helm]
== `xtdb-azure` Helm Charts

For setting up a production-ready XTDB cluster on Azure, we provide a **Helm** chart built specifically for Azure environments.

=== Installation

The Helm chart can be installed directly from the link:https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/pkgs/container/helm-xtdb-azure[**Github Container Registry** releases]. 

This will use the default configuration for the deployment, setting any required values as needed:  

```bash
helm install xtdb-azure oci://ghcr.io/xtdb/helm-xtdb-azure \
  --version 2.0.0-snapshot \
  --namespace xtdb-deployment \
  --set xtdbConfig.storageContainerName=<storage_account_container> \
  --set xtdbConfig.storageAccountName=<storage_account_name> \
  --set xtdbConfig.userManagedIdentityClientId=<user_managed_identity_client_id> 
```

We provide a number of parameters for configuring numerous parts of the deployment, see the link:https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/tree/main/azure/helm[`values.yaml` file] or call `helm show values`:

```bash
helm show values oci://ghcr.io/xtdb/helm-xtdb-azure \
  --version 2.0.0-snapshot 
```

=== Resources

By default, the following resources are deployed by the Helm chart:

* A `StatefulSet` containing a configurable number of XTDB nodes, using the link:#docker-image[**xtdb-azure** docker image]
* A `PersistentVolumeClaim` for each member of the `StatefulSet` (default size of 50 GiB, default storage class of link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-disk-csi#dynamically-create-azure-disks-pvs-by-using-the-built-in-storage-classes[**managed-csi**^]).
* A `LoadBalancer` Kubernetes service to expose the XTDB cluster to the internet.
* A `ClusterIP` service for exposing the **Prometheus** metrics from the nodes.
* A `ServiceAccount` used for authenticating the XTDB nodes with the Azure Storage Account (to be setup with a **Federated Identity Credential**).

=== Pulling the Chart Locally

The chart can also be pulled from the **Github Container Registry**, allowing further configuration of the templates within:

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/xtdb/helm-xtdb-azure \
  --version 2.0.0-snapshot \
  --untar
```

[#docker-image]
== `xtdb-azure` Docker Image

The https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/pkgs/container/xtdb-azure[**xtdb-azure**^] image is optimized for running XTDB in Azure environments, and is deployed on every release to XTDB.

By default, it will use Azure Blob Storage for object storage and Kafka for transaction logs, including dependencies for both.

=== Configuration

The following environment variables configure the `xtdb-azure` image:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Variable                          | Description

| `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`
| Kafka bootstrap server containing the XTDB topics.

| `XTDB_TX_TOPIC`
| Kafka topic to be used as the transaction log.

| `XTDB_FILES_TOPIC`
| Kafka topic to be used for node file notifications.

| `XTDB_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`
| Name of the Azure Storage Account.

| `XTDB_AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER`
| Name of the Azure Storage Container.

| `XTDB_AZURE_USER_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`
| Azure Client ID for the User Assigned Managed Identity used for authentication.

| `XTDB_LOCAL_DISK_CACHE`
| Path to the local disk cache for object storage.

| `XTDB_LOGGING_LEVEL`
| Sets the root logging level for the node - defaults to `INFO`. See link:troubleshooting/overview#loglevel["Increasing the Log Level"^] for more information.

| `XTDB_NODE_ID`
| Persistent node id for labelling Prometheus metrics.
|===

=== Using the "private auth" Configuration File

For setups requiring private/authenticated Kafka instances, we provide the "private auth" configuration file.

To switch from the default configuration above to the authenticated Kafka configuration, update the `COMMAND` of the docker container as follows:

[source, bash]
----
CMD ["-f", "azure_config_private_auth.yaml"]
----

In addition to the standard environment variables, the following environment variables are required for private/authenticated Kafka.

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Variable                          | Description

| `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM`
| SASL mechanism to use for Kafka authentication (e.g., `PLAIN`).

| `KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL`
| Security protocol for Kafka (e.g., `SASL_SSL`).

| `KAFKA_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG`
| JAAS configuration for Kafka SASL authentication, (e.g. `org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="user" password="password";`).

| `XTDB_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ENDPOINT`
| The full endpoint of the storage account which has the storage container.

|===

NOTE: We would **strongly** recommend users mount the `KAFKA_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG` env as a secret on the container.

=== Using a Custom Node Configuration

For advanced usage, XTDB allows the above YAML configuration to be overridden to customize the running node's system/modules.

In order to override the default configuration:

. Mount a custom YAML configuration file to the container.
. Override the `COMMAND` of the docker container to use the custom configuration file, ie:
+
[source, bash]
----
CMD ["-f", "/path/to/custom-config.yaml"]
----

[#storage]
== Azure Blob Storage

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/storage/blobs[**Azure Blob Storage**^] can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's link:config/storage#remote[remote storage^] module.

=== Infrastructure Requirements

To use Azure Blob Storage as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

. An **Azure Storage Account**, containing a **Storage Account Container**.
. Appropriate **permissions** for the storage account:

[source,json]
----
{
  "permissions": [
    {
      "actions": [
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/delete",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read"
      ],
      "notActions": [],
      "dataActions": [
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/write",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/delete",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/add/action",
        "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/move/action"
      ],
      "notDataActions": []
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Authentication

XTDB uses the Azure SDK for authentication, relying on the `DefaultAzureCredential`. This supports multiple authentication methods, including Managed Identity. For more details, refer to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable[Azure Documentation^].

=== Configuration

To use the Azure module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !Azure
    # -- required

    # --- At least one of storageAccount or storageAccountEndpoint is required

    # The name of the storage account which has the storage container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    storageAccount: storage-account

    # The full endpoint of the storage account which has the storage container
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # storageAccountEndpoint: https://storage-account.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net

    # The name of the blob storage container to be used as the object store
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    container: xtdb-container

    # -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all of your files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be located under a "foo" sub-directory
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node
    #
    # Azure Client ID of a User Assigned Managed Identity -
    # required when using them for authentication to Azure Services ie, inside of an Azure App Container.
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # userManagedIdentityClientId: user-managed-identity-client-id

  localDiskCache: /var/cache/xtdb/object-store

[#monitoring]
== Application Insights Monitoring

XTDB supports reporting metrics to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview[**Azure Application Insights**^] for performance and health monitoring.

=== Configuration

To enable Application Insights monitoring, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
modules:
  - !AzureMonitor
    connectionString: !Env XTDB_AZURE_APP_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING
----

Providing a valid `connectionString` linked to a pre-existing Application Insights resource is required.
