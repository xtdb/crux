== Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's remote storage module.

=== Infrastructure

Prior to deploying any infrastructure, you will need to ensure that the following APIs are active within your Google Cloud Project:

* Cloud Storage API
* IAM API
* Cloud Deployment Manager API (if using our template)

[#deployment-manager]
[NOTE]
====
We provide a https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/tree/main/modules/google-cloud/cloud-deployment-manager[parameterized 'Cloud Deployment Manager' template] to help set up everything that you need.
====

To use Google Cloud Storage as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

* A **Cloud Storage bucket**
* A **custom role** for all of the necessary permissions for XTDB to use the bucket (get, create, delete, list, and update storage objects - see below for example role from the template)

=== Authentication


Authentication is done via Googleâ€™s "Application Default Credentials" - see the https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/README.md#application-default-credentials[Google Cloud documentation] for setup instructions.

=== Configuration

To use the Google Cloud module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !GoogleCloud
    # -- required

    # The name of the GCP project that the bucket is contained within
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    projectId: xtdb-project

    # The Cloud Storage bucket which the documents will be stored within
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    bucket: xtdb-bucket

    # -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all of your files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be located under a "foo" sub-directory
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node
