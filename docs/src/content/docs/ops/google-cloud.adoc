XTDB provides modular support for Google Cloud environments, including a prebuilt Docker image, integrations with **Google Cloud Storage**, and configuration options for deploying onto Google Cloud infrastructure.

== Required Infrastructure

In order to run a Google Cloud based XTDB cluster, the following infrastructure is required:

* A **Google Cloud Storage bucket** for remote storage.
* A **Kafka cluster** for transaction logs.
** For more information on setting up Kafka for usage with XTDB, see the link:config/tx-log/kafka[Kafka configuration^] docs.
* A service account with the necessary permissions to access the storage bucket and Kafka cluster.
* XTDB nodes configured to communicate with the Kafka cluster and Google Cloud Storage.

NOTE: We would recommend running XTDB in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, which provides a managed Kubernetes environment in Google Cloud.

[#docker-image]
== `xtdb-google-cloud` Docker Image

The https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/pkgs/container/xtdb-google-cloud[**xtdb-google-cloud**^] image is optimized for running XTDB in Google Cloud environments and is deployed on every release to XTDB.

[source,bash]
----
xtdb/xtdb-google-cloud:2.0.0-beta4
----

By default, it will use Google Cloud Storage for storage and Kafka for transaction logs, including dependencies for both.

=== Configuration

The following environment variables are used to configure the `xtdb-google-cloud` image:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Variable              | Description

| `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`
| Kafka bootstrap server containing the XTDB topics.

| `XTDB_TX_TOPIC`
| Kafka topic to be used as the transaction log.

| `XTDB_FILES_TOPIC`
| Kafka topic to be used for node file notifications.

| `XTDB_GCP_PROJECT_ID`
| GCP project ID containing the bucket.

| `XTDB_GCP_BUCKET`
| Name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket used for remote storage.

| `XTDB_GCP_LOCAL_DISK_CACHE_PATH`
| Path to the local disk cache.

| `XTDB_LOGGING_LEVEL`
| Sets the root logging level for the node - defaults to `INFO`. See link:troubleshooting/overview#loglevel["Increasing the Log Level"^] for more information.

| `XTDB_NODE_ID`
| Persistent node id for labelling Prometheus metrics.

=== Using a Custom Node Configuration

For advanced usage, XTDB allows the above YAML configuration to be overridden to customize the running node's system/modules.

In order to override the default configuration:

. Mount a custom YAML configuration file to the container.
. Override the `COMMAND` of the docker container to use the custom configuration file, ie:
+
[source, bash]
----
CMD ["-f", "/path/to/custom-config.yaml"]
----


[#storage]
== Google Cloud Storage

https://cloud.google.com/storage?hl=en[**Google Cloud Storage**^] can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's link:config/storage#remote[remote storage^] module.

=== Infrastructure Requirements

To use Google Cloud Storage as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

. A **Google Cloud Storage bucket**
. A **custom role** with the necessary permissions for XTDB to use the bucket:
+
[source,yaml]
----
type: gcp-types/iam-v1:projects.roles
name: custom-role-name
properties:
  parent: projects/project-name
  roleId: custom-role-name
  role:
    title: XTDB Custom Role
    stage: GA
    description: Custom role for XTDB - allows usage of containers.
    includedPermissions:
      - storage.objects.create
      - storage.objects.delete
      - storage.objects.get
      - storage.objects.list
      - storage.objects.update
      - storage.buckets.get
----

=== Authentication

XTDB uses Google's "Application Default Credentials" for authentication. 
See the https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/README.md#application-default-credentials[Google Cloud documentation^] for setup instructions.

=== Configuration

To use the Google Cloud module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !GoogleCloud
    ## -- required

    # The name of the GCP project containing the bucket
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    projectId: xtdb-project

    # The Cloud Storage bucket to store documents
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    bucket: xtdb-bucket

    ## -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be under a "foo" sub-directory
    # (Can be set as an !Env value)
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node

  localDiskCache: /var/cache/xtdb/object-store
