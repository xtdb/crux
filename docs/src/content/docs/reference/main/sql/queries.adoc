For examples on how to run SQL queries in each client library, see the individual driver documentation:

Fuller SQL reference documentation will follow shortly.

For now, the following is a subset of what's currently possible in XTDB SQL:

[railroad]
----
const insertInto = rr.Sequence("INSERT", "INTO", "<table-name>")
const cols = rr.Sequence("(", rr.OneOrMore("<col-name>", ","), ")")
const values = "<vals>"
return rr.Diagram(rr.Stack(insertInto, rr.Choice(0, rr.Sequence(cols, "VALUES", values), "<query>"), ))
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT <value> [ [ AS ] <column_name> ] [ , ... ]
FROM <relation> [ [ AS ] <table_alias> [ (<column_name> [, ...] ) ]] [ , ... ]
     [ <join_clause>+ ]
[ WHERE <predicate> ]
[ GROUP BY <value> [ , ... ] ]
[ ORDER BY <value> [ (ASC | DESC) ] [ , ... ] ]
[ LIMIT <number> ]
[ OFFSET <number> ]

relation :: <table_name> [ <for_system_time> ] [ <for_valid_time> ]
          | ( <sub_query> )
          | ( VALUES (<column_name> [ , ... ]) )

for_system_time :: FOR SYSTEM_TIME <temporal_range> | FOR ALL SYSTEM_TIME | FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL
for_valid_time :: FOR VALID_TIME <temporal_range> | FOR ALL VALID_TIME | FOR VALID_TIME ALL
temporal_range :: AS OF <date_time>
                | FROM <date_time> TO <date_time> -- start inclusive, end exclusive
                | BETWEEN <date_time> AND <date_time> -- start inclusive, end inclusive

join_clause :: [ join_type ] JOIN <relation> <join_condition> [ ... ]
join_type :: INNER | LEFT [ OUTER ] | RIGHT [ OUTER ] | FULL [ OUTER ]
join_condition :: USING ( <column_name> [ , ... ] )
                | ON <predicate>

predicate :: <value> <binary_op> <value>
           | <value> [ NOT ] IN ( <query> )
           | [ NOT ] EXISTS ( <query> )

value :: <predicate>
       | <function> ( [ <arg> [ , ... ] ])
       | (<query>)
       | NEST_ONE(<query>)
       | NEST_MANY(<query>)

* Temporarily, column names in XTDB SQL must be qualified - e.g. `SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name FROM users u`
* Predicates and functions are taken from the XT 'standard library'.

== Nested sub-queries

Nested sub-queries allow you to easily create tree-shaped results, using `NEST_MANY` and `NEST_ONE`:

* For example, if you have a one-to-many relationship (e.g. customers -> orders), you can write a query that, for each customer, returns an array of their orders as nested objects:
+
--
[source,sql]
----
SELECT c._id AS customer_id, c.name,
       NEST_MANY(SELECT o._id AS order_id, o.value
                 FROM orders o
                 WHERE o.customer_id = c._id
                 ORDER BY o._id)
         AS orders
FROM customers c
----

=>

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "customerId": 0,
    "name": "bob",
    "orders": [ { "orderId": 0, "value": 26.20 }, { "orderId": 1, "value": 8.99 } ]
  },
  {
    "customerId": 1,
    "name": "alice",
    "orders": [ { "orderId": 2, "value": 12.34 } ]
  }
]
----
--
* In the other direction (many-to-one) - for each order, additionally return details about the customer - use `NEST_ONE` to get a single nested object:
+
--
[source,sql]
----
SELECT o._id AS order_id, o.value,
       NEST_ONE(SELECT c.name FROM customers c
                WHERE c._id = o.customer_id)
         AS customer
FROM orders o
ORDER BY o._id
----

=>

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "orderId": 0,
    "value": 26.20,
    "customer": { "name": "bob" }
  },
  {
    "order-id": 1,
    "value": 8.99,
    "customer": { "name": "bob" }
  },
  {
    "order-id": 2,
    "value": 12.34,
    "customer": { "name": "alice" }
  }
]

[NOTE]
====
There is a table and column name mapping between SQL and XTQL: documents inserted with XTQL have their hyphens translated to underscores, and their namespace segments converted to `$` symbols, as hyphens, periods and slashes are not valid symbols in SQL identifiers.

For example, `:foo.bar/baz-quux` in XTQL is referenced in SQL as `foo$bar$baz_quux`.

The built-in XTDB columns `:xt/id`, `:xt/valid-from`, `:xt/valid-to` etc are referenced in SQL as `_id`, `_valid_from` and `_valid_to` respectively.

This mapping is reversed when querying SQL documents from XTQL.
