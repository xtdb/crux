|===

[NOTE]
====
* Date-times are first cast to comparable resolutions before performing arithmetic.
  e.g. adding a date-time with second resolution to a duration with microsecond resolution will first cast the date-time to microsecond resolution.
* If local and TZ-aware date-times are passed to the same operation, the local date-time is first converted to a TZ-aware date-time using the query's time zone.
* If any part of any operation would cause an overflow (including implicit casts), a runtime exception will be raised.
====

== Current time

XTDB allows fine-grained control over user requests for the 'current time', to allow for fully repeatable queries.

* The wall-clock time of a query is fixed when the query starts.
  It can be explicitly specified by passing `:current-time` to the query options; otherwise, it will snapshot the current-time of the XTDB node.
* The wall-clock time of a query within a transaction is fixed to the system-time of the transaction, as recorded by the transaction log (or overridden using the `:system-time` option to `submit-tx`).
* Each transaction/query has a default time-zone, which defaults to the time-zone of the XTDB node's JVM unless overridden in the query options (`default-tz`).

[cols="3,3,8"]
|===
| XTQL | SQL |

| `(current-timestamp <precision>?)`
| `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

  `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(precision)`
| Returns the current wall-clock date/time as a timestamp with time-zone.

| `(current-date <precision>?)`
| `CURRENT_DATE`

  `CURRENT_DATE(precision)`
| Returns the current UTC wall-clock date.

| `(current-time <precision>?)`
| `CURRENT_TIME`

  `CURRENT_TIME(precision)`
| Returns the current UTC wall-clock time.

| `(local-timestamp <precision>?)`
| `LOCAL_TIMESTAMP`

  `LOCAL_TIMESTAMP(precision)`
| Returns the current wall-clock date/time as a local timestamp (without time-zone), as in the query's time-zone.

| `(current-timestamp <precision>?)`
| `LOCAL_TIME`

  `LOCAL_TIME(precision)`
| Returns the current wall-clock time as a local time (without time-zone), as in the query's time-zone.

|===


== Periods

Periods in XTDB are represented as a struct with a `:start` and `:end` timestamp.

Most of these period comparators have 'strictly' and 'immediate' variants.

* 'strictly' variants check that the two periods don't meet - e.g. `precedes?` will return true if the earlier period ends at the same time the second period starts; `strictly-precedes?` will return false.
* 'immediately' variants check that the two periods _do_ meet.

These functions will return null if any of their arguments are null.
