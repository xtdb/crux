title: Aggregate functions
---

Aggregate functions can be used within the `aggregate` clause in XTQL, or the `SELECT` clause in SQL.

In line with the SQL spec (which XTDB also respects in XTQL queries):

* Except in the case of `(row-count)` / `COUNT(*)`, null values in the column are removed before the aggregate is calculated.
* Without grouping columns, aggregate functions will always return exactly one row - if the input column is empty (after nulls have been removed), the result will be a single row containing a null value.

== Numeric aggregate functions

[cols='3,3,8']
|===
| XTQL | SQL |

| `(avg xs)` | `AVG([ALL] xs)` | average (mean)
| `(avg-distinct xs)` | `AVG(DISTINCT xs)` | average (mean) of distinct values
| `(count xs)` | `COUNT([ALL] xs)` | count
| `(count-distinct xs)` | `COUNT(DISTINCT xs)` | count of distinct values
| `(row-count)` | `COUNT(*)` | row count
| `(max xs)` | `MAX([ALL] xs)` | maximum
| `(max-distinct xs)` | `MAX(DISTINCT xs)` | maximum of distinct values
| `(min xs)` | `MIN([ALL] xs)` | minimum
| `(min-distinct xs)` | `MIN(DISTINCT xs)` | minimum of distinct values
| `(stddev-pop xs)` | `STDDEV_POP(xs)` | population standard deviation
| `(stddev-samp xs)` | `STDDEV_SAMP(xs)` | sample standard deviation
| `(sum xs)` | `SUM([ALL] xs)` | sum
| `(sum-distinct xs)` | `SUM(DISTINCT xs)` | sum of distinct values
| `(var-pop xs)` | `VAR_POP(xs)` | population variance
| `(var-samp xs)` | `VAR_SAMP(xs)` | sample variance
|===

* `min`/`max` aggregates are not yet supported on string values.

== Boolean aggregate functions

[cols='3,3,8']
|===
| XTQL | SQL |

| `(bool-and xs)`

`(every xs)`
| `BOOL_AND(xs)`

  `EVERY(xs)`
| true if all values are true; false otherwise

| `(bool-or xs)`
| `BOOL_OR(xs)`
| false if all values are false; true otherwise
|===

== Composite-type aggregate functions

[cols='3,3,8']
|===
| XTQL | SQL |

| `(array-agg xs)` | `ARRAY_AGG(xs)` | return an array of all of the input values
|===
