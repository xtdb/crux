NOTE: The contents of this page focus mainly on construction and casting of Temporal Types. For information on functions which apply to temporal types, see the link:../stdlib/temporal[Temporal Functions] page.

This document outlines the supported types of XTDB, alongside their usage, construction and casting behaviors.

== Supported Temporal Types

[cols="3,5",options="header"]
|===
|XTDB Type |Description

|`TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIMEZONE]`
|Represents both date and time *without* a time zone offset.

|`TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`
|Represents both date and time *with* a time zone offset.

|`DATE`
|Represents a date without a time component.

|`TIME [WITHOUT TIME ZONE]`
|Represents the time of day without a date.

|`INTERVAL [INTERVAL QUALIFIER] [(p)]`
|Represents a span of time without a specific start or end timestamp. 

|`PERIOD`
|Represents a specific start and end timestamp, capturing a range of time.

|`DURATION`
|Represents duration of time - purely in hours, minutes, seconds and fractional seconds.
|===


== Temporal Constructors and Literals

Temporal values are instantiated using syntax compliant with SQL standards or ISO8601 strings for broader compatibility.

=== SQL Examples

[source,sql]
----
DATE '2023-03-15' -- Constructs a date.
TIMESTAMP '2023-03-15 12:00:00' -- Timestamp without time zone.
TIMESTAMP '2023-03-15T12:00:00' -- Timestamp without time zone in ISO8601 format.
TIMESTAMP '2023-03-15 12:00:00+01:00' -- Timestamp with time zone.
TIME '14:30:00' -- Time without time zone.
INTERVAL '1-2' YEAR TO MONTH -- A Year-Month Interval specified with an interval qualifier.
INTERVAL 'P1Y2M' -- The Same Interval specified in a ISO8601 format.
INTERVAL '1 2:30:10.111111' DAY TO SECOND(6) -- A Day-Time Interval specified with an interval qualifier.
INTERVAL 'P1DT2H30M10.111111S' -- The Same Interval specified in a ISO8601 format.
DURATION 'P20H3M11.1S' -- A Duration specified in ISO8601 format.
PERIOD(DATE '1998-01-05', DATE '1998-01-12') -- A Period specified with two dates.

=== XTQL / Client Library Examples

The temporal types can also be constructed for use in XTQL queries and transactions within our various client libraries. For examples of these, see the individual client library documentation:


== Casting Between Temporal Types

There are a number of considerations when casting between temporal types:

* Casting from `date` to `timestamp` assumes the start of the day.
* Casting to `timestamp with time zone` will consider the system default time zone.
* When explicitly casting to most temporal types, can specify an optional fractional precision to truncate the value to:
** In SQL, the syntax for this would be `CAST(value AS TYPE(<precision>))`.
* Casting to/from `varchar` involves formatting or parsing as ISO8601 strings.
* Intervals have specific casting behaviors, which are detailed in the next section.

== Intervals

Internally within XTDB, intervals are represented in a number of different formats, including:

- `Month-Day-Nanosecond`
- `Year-Month` 
- `Day-Time`

Constructing an interval **using an ISO8601 string** will _always_ return a `Month-Day-Nanosecond` interval.

=== Constructing with an Interval Qualifier

Constructing an interval **using an interval qualifier** will return a different interval type, dependent on the qualifier used:

[cols="5,3",options="header"]
|===
|Supported Interval Qualifier|Interval Type
|`YEAR TO MONTH` |`Year-Month`
|`YEAR`|`Year-Month`
|`MONTH`|`Year-Month`
|`DAY`|`Day-Time`
|`HOUR`|`Day-Time`
|`MINUTE`|`Day-Time`
|`SECOND [<leading precision>, <fractional precision>]`|`Day-Time`
|`DAY TO HOUR`|`Month-Day-Nanosecond`
|`DAY TO MINUTE`|`Month-Day-Nanosecond`
|`DAY TO SECOND [<fractional precision>]`|`Month-Day-Nanosecond`
|`HOUR TO SECOND [<fractional precision>]`|`Month-Day-Nanosecond`
|`HOUR TO MINUTE`|`Month-Day-Nanosecond`
|`MINUTE TO SECOND [<fractional precision>]`|`Month-Day-Nanosecond`
|===

Dependent on interval type, the exact functions and operations available will differ.

=== Casting between Intervals

Explicitly casting between intervals is supported, but only between **intervals of the same type**. When casting between intervals, it is required to specify an interval qualifier, 
otherwise the cast operation will not do anything. Casting to an interval qualifier will:

* **Normalize** the interval to the new qualifier
** ie. If an Interval of `25 hours` is cast to `DAY TO HOUR`, it will be normalized to `1 day 1 hour`.
* **Truncate** the interval to the new qualifier 
** ie. If an Interval of `25 hours` is cast to `DAY`, it will be truncated to `1 day`.

=== Casting to/from Intervals

When casting to/from intervals from other types, the following rules apply:

* Casting from `varchar` to an interval:
** **Without** specifying an interval qualifier - will parse the string as an ISO8601 interval, and will return a `Month-Day-Nanosecond` interval.
** **With** an interval qualifier - will parse the string and output the type of interval based on the qualifier.
* Casting from an `interval` to `varchar` will format the interval as an ISO8601 string.
* Casting from an `interval` to `duration`:
** Will only work if the interval is a `Month-Day-Nano` interval.
** Will only work if the month count is 0.
** Will return the entire interval as it's ISO 8601 duration - any `days` will be converted to 24 hours.
* Casting from a `duration` to `interval`:
** Always returns a `Month-Day-Nanosecond` interval.
** **Without** specifying an interval qualifier - always returns with zero days and put the whole duration into the time part of the interval.
** **With** an interval qualifier - will normalize and truncate the duration according to the interval qualifier (will normalize hours to days, with day=24 hours, if qualifier contains `DAY`).
