= XTQL Transactions

XTQL transactions are submitted through `xtdb.api/submit-tx` (`xtdb.api` aliased here as `xt`).

* `(xt/submit-tx <node> <tx-ops> <opts>?)`: returns the transaction key of the submitted transaction.
** `tx-ops`: vector of link:#tx-ops[transaction operations].
* `(xt/submit-tx& <node> <tx-ops> <opts>?)`: returns a `CompletableFuture` of the transaction key.

XT submit options are an optional map of the following keys:

* `system-time`: overrides system-time for the transaction, mustn't be earlier than any previous system-time.
* `default-tz`: overrides the default time zone for the transaction.

== Transaction operations

=== `put`

Upserts a document into the given table, optionally during the given valid time period.

`(xt/put <table> <document>)`

* `table` (keyword).
* `document` (map): must contain `:xt/id`.

To specify a valid-time range:

* `+(-> (xt/put <table> <document>) (xt/starting-from <from>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/put <table> <document>) (xt/until <to>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/put <table> <document>) (xt/during <from> <to))+`

where:

* `from` (timestamp): may be `nil`.
    Defaults to the current time of the transaction if not provided.
* `to` (timestamp): may be `nil`.
    Defaults to the end-of-time if not provided.

=== `insert-into`

Inserts documents into a table from the given query.

`(xt/insert-into <table> <query>)`

* `table` (keyword): table to insert into.
* `query` (link:./queries[`Query`]).
** The query must return an `xt/id` column.
** To specify a valid-time range, the query may return `xt/valid-from` and/or `xt/valid-to` columns.
   If not provided, these will default as per link:#_put[`put`].

For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/insert-into :users
                (from :old-users [xt/id {:first-name given-name} {:last-name family-name}]))

;; equivalent to:
;; "INSERT INTO users SELECT xt$id, first_name AS given_name, last_name AS family_name FROM old_users"
----

=== `update-table`

Updates documents in a given table based on the provided query.

`(xt/update-table <table> <opts> <unify-clauses*>)`

* `table` (keyword): table to update.
* `opts` (map):
** `:bind-spec` (link:./queries#binding_specs[`BindingSpec`], optional): select the documents to update using binding constraints.
*** If not provided, this will update every document in the table.
*** May also bind extra logic variables for use in the `:set` clause or `unify-clauses`.
** `:set` (map, keyword -> link:./queries#expressions[`Expr`]): columns to update.
* `unify-clauses` (link:./queries#unify_clauses[unify clause], optional): extra clauses to unify with (e.g. to join against another table).
  See link:./queries#unify[`unify`] for more details.

For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (xt/update-table :users {:bind [{:email $email}, version],
                             :set {:version (inc version)}})
    (xt/with-op-args {:email "james@example.com"}))

;; equivalent to:
;; "UPDATE users SET version = version + 1 WHERE email = 'james@example.com'"
----

To specify a valid-time range:

* `+(-> (xt/update-table ...) (xt/starting-from <from>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/update-table ...) (xt/until <to>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/update-table ...) (xt/during <from> <to))+`

with default behaviour as per link:#_put[`put`], above.

=== `delete`

Deletes a document from the given table, optionally during the given valid time period.

`(xt/delete <table> <id>)`

To specify a valid-time range:

* `+(-> (xt/delete ...) (xt/starting-from <from>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/delete ...) (xt/until <to>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/delete ...) (xt/during <from> <to))+`

with default behaviour as per link:#_put[`put`], above.

=== `delete-from`

Deletes documents from the given table, based on the provided query.

`(xt/delete-from <table> <bind-spec> <unify-clauses>*)`

* `table` (keyword): table to delete from.
* `bind-spec` (link:./queries#binding_specs[`BindingSpec`], optional): select the documents to delete using binding constraints.
** If not provided, this will delete every document in the table.
** May also bind extra logic variables for use in the `unify-clauses`.
* `unify-clauses` (link:./queries#unify_clauses[unify clause], optional): extra clauses to unify with (e.g. to join against another table).
  See link:./queries#unify[`unify`] for more details.

For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/delete-from :users {:email "james@example.com"})

;; equivalent to:
;; "DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'james@example.com'"


(xt/delete-from :posts {:bind [author-id]}
                (from :authors [{:xt/id author-id, :email "james@example.com"}]))

;; equivalent to:
;; "DELETE FROM users
;;  WHERE author_id IN (SELECT author_id FROM email = 'james@example.com'")
----

To specify a valid-time range:

* `+(-> (xt/delete-from ...) (xt/starting-from <from>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/delete-from ...) (xt/until <to>))+`
* `+(-> (xt/delete-from ...) (xt/during <from> <to))+`

with default behaviour as per link:#_put[`put`], above.

=== `erase`

Irrevocably erase the document from the given table (including through system time), for all valid-time.

`(xt/erase <table> <id>)`

=== `erase-from`

Irrevocably erase the document from the given table (including through system time), based on the provided query.

`(xt/erase-from <table> <bind-spec> <unify-clauses>*)`

* `table` (keyword): table to erase from.
* `bind-spec` (link:./queries#binding_specs[BindingSpec]): select the documents to erase using binding constraints.
  May also bind extra logic variables for use in the `unify-clauses`.
* `unify-clauses` (link:./queries#unify_clauses[unify clause], optional): extra clauses to unify with (e.g. to join against another table).
  See link:./queries#unify[`unify`] for more details.

For example:
[source,clojure]
----
(-> (xt/erase-from :users {:email $email})
    (xt/with-op-args {:email "james@example.com"}))

;; equivalent to:
;; "ERASE FROM users WHERE email = 'james@example.com'"


(-> (xt/erase-from :posts {:bind [author-id]}
                   (from :authors [{:xt/id author-id, :email $email}]))
    (xt/with-op-args {:email "james@example.com"}))

;; equivalent to:
;; "ERASE FROM users
;;  WHERE author_id IN (SELECT author_id FROM email = ?)
----

Notes:

* Erase operations apply for all valid-time.

[#asserts]
=== Asserts: `assert-exists`, `assert-not-exists`

Within a transaction, `assert-exists`/`assert-not-exists` operations assert that the given query returns at least one row/no rows respectively - if not, the transaction will roll back.

`(xt/assert-exists <query>)`

`(xt/assert-not-exists <query>)`

* `query` (link:./queries[`Query`]): query to evaluate.

This can be used to enforce consistency constraints - for example, to assert that there's no user with a certain email address before adding one:

[source,clojure]
----
[(-> (xt/assert-not-exists (from :users [{:email $email}]))
     (xt/with-op-args [{:email "james@example.com"}]))
 (xt/put :users {:xt/id :james, :email "james@example.com", ...})]
----

=== `call`

Call a transaction function.

`(xt/call <fn-id> <args>*)`

Transaction functions are defined using `put-fn`:

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/put-fn :increment
           '(fn [args...]
              ...
              ))
----

Transaction functions are evaluated with the Small Clojure Interpreter (https://github.com/babashka/sci[SCI^]).
They should return a vector of other transaction operations (including invoking other transaction functions).
If they return false, or throw an exception, the transaction will be rolled back.

There are a few functions available in scope during the transaction function:

* `(q <query> <opts>?)` runs an link:./queries[XTQL query]
* `(sql-q <query> <opts>?)`: runs a SQL query.
* `+*current-tx*+`: the current transaction being indexed.
