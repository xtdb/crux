(defn q&
  "asynchronously query an XTDB node.
  q param is a Datalog query in map form, args should line
  up with those specified in the query.

  Please see Datalog query language docs for more details.

  This function returns a CompleteableFuture containing the results of its query as a vector of maps

  Transaction Basis:

  In XTDB there are a number of ways to control at what point in time a query is ran,
  this is done via a basis map optionally supplied as part of the query map.

  In the case a basis is not provided the query is guaranteed to run sometime after
  the latest transaction submitted by this connection/node.

  Alternatively a basis map containing reference to a specific transaction can be supplied,
  in this case the query will be run exactly at that transaction, ensuring the repeatability of queries.

  This tx reference (known as a TransactionInstant) is the same map returned by submit-tx

  (q node
    (-> '{:find ...
          :where ...}
        (assoc :basis {:tx tx})))

  Additionally a Basis Timeout can be supplied to the query map, which if after the specified duration
  the query's requested basis is not complete the query will be cancelled.
