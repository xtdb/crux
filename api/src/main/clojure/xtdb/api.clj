  "General query execution function for controlling the realized result set.

  Returns a reducible that, when reduced (with an initial value), runs the query and yields the result.
  `plan-q` returns an IReduceInit object so you must provide an initial value when calling reduce on it.

  The main use case for `plan-q` is to stream large results sets without having the entire result set in memory.
  A common way to do this is to call run! together with a side-effecting function process-row!
  (which could for example write the row to a file):

  (run! process-row! (xt/plan-q node ...))

  - query: either an XTQL or SQL query.
  - opts:
    - `:basis`: see 'Transaction Basis'
    - `:args`: arguments to pass to the query.
    - `:default-tz`: overrides the default time zone for the query

  For example:

  (q node '(from ...))

  (q node '(from :foo [{:a $a, :b $b}])
      {:a a-value, :b b-value})

  (q node \"SELECT foo.id, foo.v FROM foo WHERE foo.id = 'my-foo'\")
  (q node \"SELECT foo.id, foo.v FROM foo WHERE foo.id = ?\" {:args [foo-id]})

  Please see XTQL/SQL query language docs for more details.

  This function returns the results of its query as a vector of maps

  Transaction Basis:

  In XTDB there are a number of ways to control at what point in time a query is run -
  this is done via a basis map optionally supplied as part of the query map.

  In the case a basis is not provided the query is guaranteed to run sometime after
  the latest transaction submitted by this connection/node.

  Alternatively a basis map containing reference to a specific transaction can be supplied,
  in this case the query will be run exactly at that transaction, ensuring the repeatability of queries.

  This tx reference (known as a TransactionKey) is the same map returned by submit-tx

  (q node '(from ...)
     {:basis {:at-tx tx}})

  Additionally a Basis Timeout can be supplied to the query map, which if after the specified duration
  the query's requested basis is not complete the query will be cancelled.

  (q node '(from ...)
     {:tx-timeout (Duration/ofSeconds 1)})"
