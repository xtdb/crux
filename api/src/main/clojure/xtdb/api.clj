  "asynchronously query an XTDB node.

  - query: either an XTQL or SQL query.

    - `:args`: arguments to pass to the query.

  For example:

  (q& node '(from ...))

  This function returns a CompletableFuture containing the results of its query as a vector of maps

  Transaction Basis:

  In XTDB there are a number of ways to control at what point in time a query is run -
  this is done via a basis map optionally supplied as part of the query map.

  In the case a basis is not provided the query is guaranteed to run sometime after
  the latest transaction submitted by this connection/node.

  Alternatively a basis map containing reference to a specific transaction can be supplied,
  in this case the query will be run exactly at that transaction, ensuring the repeatability of queries.

  This tx key is the same map returned by `submit-tx`.

  (q& node '(from ...)
      {:basis {:at-tx tx}})

  Additionally a tx timeout can be supplied to the query map, which if after the specified duration
  the query's requested basis is not complete the query will be cancelled.
