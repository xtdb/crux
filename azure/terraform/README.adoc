# XTDB Azure Terraform Sample

Contained within this directory are sample terraform files for deploying XTDB to Azure. The samples are designed to be as simple as possible, and are intended to be used as a starting point for your own deployments.

For more information on what is being deployed, how to use the templates and how to setup an XTDB cluster on Azure, see the link:https://docs.xtdb.com/ops/guides/starting-with-azure.html["Setting up a cluster on Azure"^] guide.

## Pulling the files locally

We can fetch the contents of this folder using the terraform CLI:
