[XTDB](https://xtdb.com) is a general purpose database with graph-oriented bitemporal indexes.
Datalog, SQL & EQL queries are supported, and Java, HTTP & Clojure APIs are
provided.

XTDB follows an _unbundled_ architectural approach, which means that it is
assembled from decoupled components through the use of an immutable log and
document store at the core of its design. A range of storage options are
available for embedded usage and cloud native scaling.

Bitemporal indexing of schemaless documents enables broad possibilities for
creating layered extensions on top, such as to add additional transaction,
query, and schema capabilities. In addition to SQL, XTDB supplies a
[Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) query interface that can be
used to express complex joins and recursive graph traversals.

## Unbundled Architecture

XTDB embraces the transaction log as the central point of coordination when
running as a distributed system. Use of a separate document store enables simple
eviction of active and historical data to assist with technical compliance for
information privacy regulations.

> What do we have to gain from turning the database inside out? Simpler code,
> better scalability, better robustness, lower latency, and more flexibility for
> doing interesting things with data.

This design makes it feasible and desirable to embed XTDB nodes directly within
your application processes, which reduces deployment complexity and eliminates
round-trip overheads when running complex application queries.

## Repo Layout

XTDB is split across multiple projects which are maintained within this
repository. `core` contains the main functional components of XTDB along
with interfaces for the pluggable storage components (Kafka, LMDB, RocksDB
etc.). Implementations of these storage options are located in their own
projects.

Project directories are published to Maven independently so that you can
maintain granular dependencies on precisely the individual components needed
for your application.

## Pre-Release Snapshot Builds

Maven snapshot versions are periodically published under `dev-SNAPSHOT` and are
used to facilitate support and debugging activities during the development
cycle. To access snapshots versions, the Sonatype snapshot repository must be
added to your project definition:

```xml
<repository>
  <id>sonatype.snapshots</id>
  <name>Sonatype Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  <releases>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </releases>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
```

```clojure
;; project.clj
:repositories [["sonatype snapshots" {:url "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"}]]
```

```clojure
;; deps.edn
:mvn/repos {"sonatype snapshots" {:url "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"}}
```

In contrast to regular releases which are immutable, a `dev-SNAPSHOT` release
can be "updated" - this mutability can often be useful but may also cause
unexpected surprises when depending on `dev-SNAPSHOT` for longer than necessary.
Snapshot versions, including full `dev-<timestamp>` coordinates (which are
useful to avoid being caught out by mutation), can be browsed
[here](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/xtdb/xtdb-core/dev-SNAPSHOT/).
