# Azure Module

Within our XTDB node, we can make use of Azure Services for certain purposes. Currently, we can:

* Use *Azure Blob Storage* as the XTDB Object Store.

### Project Dependency 

In order to use any of the azure services, you will need to include a dependency on the xtdb.azure module.

_deps.edn_
```
com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-azure {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}
```

_pom.xml_
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.xtdb.labs</groupId>
    <artifactId>xtdb-azure</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Authentication

Authentication for the components in the module is done via the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable[*DefaultAzureCredential*] class - you will need to setup authentication using any of the methods listed within the Azure documentation to be able to make use of the operations inside the modules.

## Azure Blob Storage Object Store

We can swap out the implementation of the object store with one based on Azure Blob Storage. To do so, we add the `xtdb.azure/blob-object-store` key within the integrant config for our node, alongside any config:
```clojure
{
  ...
  {:xtdb.azure/blob-object-store {:storage-account "storage-account"
                                  :container "container"}}
  ...
}
```

### Parameters

These are the following parameters that can be passed within the config for our `xtdb.azure/blob-object-store`:
[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
| *Name* | *Type* | *Description* | *Required?*
| `storage-account`
| String
| The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview[storage account] that has the container to use as an object store
