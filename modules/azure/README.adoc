# Azure Module

Within our XTDB node, we can make use of Azure Services for certain purposes. Currently, we can:

* Use *Azure Blob Storage* as the XTDB Object Store.
* Use *Azure Eventhubs* as the Log.

### Project Dependency 

In order to use any of the Azure services, you will need to include a dependency on the xtdb.azure module.

_deps.edn_
```
com.xtdb.labs/xtdb-azure {:mvn/version "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}
```

_pom.xml_
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.xtdb.labs</groupId>
    <artifactId>xtdb-azure</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Authentication

Authentication for the components in the module is done via the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable[*DefaultAzureCredential*] class - you will need to setup authentication using any of the methods listed within the Azure documentation to be able to make use of the operations inside the modules.

## Azure Blob Storage Object Store

We can swap out the implementation of the object store with one based on Azure Blob Storage. To do so, we add the `xtdb.azure/blob-object-store` key within the integrant config for our node, alongside any config:
```clojure
{
  ...
  {:xtdb.azure/blob-object-store {:storage-account "storage-account"
                                  :container "container"}}
  ...
}
```

### Parameters

These are the following parameters that can be passed within the config for our `xtdb.azure/blob-object-store`:
[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
| *Name* | *Type* | *Description* | *Required?*
| `storage-account`
| String
| The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview[storage account] that has the container to use as an object store
| Yes

| `container`
| String 
| The name of the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#containers[container] to use an an object store
| Yes

|`prefix`
| String 
| A string to prefix all of your files with - for example, if "foo" is provided all xtdb files will be located under a "foo" directory
| No
|=== 

## Azure EventHub Log

We can swap out the implementation of the log with one based on Azure Eventhubs. To do so, we add the `xtdb.azure/event-hub-log` key within the integrant config for our node, alongside any config:
```clojure
{
  ...
  {::azure/event-hub-log {:namespace "eventhub-namespace"
                          :resource-group-name "resource-group-name"
                          :event-hub-name "example-event-hub"
                          :create-event-hub? true
                          :retention-period-in-days 60}}
  ...
}
```

### Parameters

These are the following parameters that can be passed within the config for our `xtdb.azure/event-hub-log`:
[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
| *Name* | *Type* | *Description* | *Required?*
| `namespace`
| String
| The Event Hubs namespace of the EventHub. 
| Yes

| `event-hub-name`
| String
| The name of the EventHub that you wish to use a log.
| Yes

| `max-wait-time`
| Duration
| A duration representing the max amount of time to wait when reading data from the log - can be provided as a Java Duration or passed as a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[duration string] or int representing a time in milliseconds. 
| No - defaults to "PT1S"

| `poll-sleep-duration`
| Duration
| A duration representing the time to sleep between reads of the log - can be provided as a Java Duration or passed as a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[duration string] or int representing a time in milliseconds. 
| No - defaults to "PT1S"

| `create-event-hub?`
| Boolean
| Whether or not XTDB should create an eventhub for you within the specified namespace. See "<<Creating the Event Hub Automatically>>" for more info.
| No - defaults to false. 

| `resource-group-name`
| String
| The name of the resource group that the eventhub namespace belongs to.
| Only if `create-event-hub?` is true

| `retention-period-in-days`
| Long
| The retention period of the Event Hub for the Log - the maximum period determined by the tier of eventhub namespace you are using, see the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-retention[Azure Docs].
| No - only needed if creating Event Hub automatically, and defaults to "7".

|=== 

### Using Event Hubs 

Some things to note when setting up Event Hubs for XTDB:

* When using EventHubs as a log - you will require a pre-existing Event Hubs namespace, see the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hubs-namespace[Azure docs].
* As a bare minimum, whichever credentials you use to authenticate to Azure for the app will require two roles on the namespace - *Azure Event Hubs Data sender* and *Azure Event Hubs Data receiver*. 

#### Creating the Event Hub Manually

When creating an eventhub manually to use as an XTDB log, there are a few properties to consider:

* Partition count should be set to *1* - XTDB will only ever use a single partition within it's implementations of Log as they are required to be *totally ordered*.
* The retention period is configurable - you will likely wish to set this to as high as you reasonably can given the pricing tier of your Event Hubs namespace. 

#### Creating the Event Hub Automatically

If `create-event-hub?` is set to `true`, XTDB will attempt to create an Event Hub on your behalf - some notes on this:

* If `create-event-hub?` is set, a number of other pieces of configuration must be done to allow your application to manage Event Hubs on your behalf:
** Whichever credentials you use to authenticate to Azure for the app will require one extra roles for the namespace - *Azure Event Hubs Data Owner*.
** Within your XTDB integrant config, you will need to directly specify the resource group the Event Hub namespace belongs to within the `resource-group-name` parameter.
** The application will require two Azure related environment variables to be set - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` & `AZURE_TENANT_ID`. See the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id[Azure docs] for more info.
* The Event Hub will only be created if the `event-hub-name` in the configuartion doesn't already exist in the given namespace - it will not start a new Event Hub every time the node restarts.
* The created Event Hub will have a single partition, and the retention period will be set based on the `retention-period-in-days` parameter (this defaults to 7 days - the maximum retention period of the 'basic' namespace pricing tier)
