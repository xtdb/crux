;; -- PROTOC-GEN-CLOJURE --
;; Implement our "Greeter" service interface.  The compiler generates
;; a defprotocol (greeter/Service, in this case), and it is our job
;; to define an implementation of every function within it.  These will be
;; invoked whenever a request arrives, similarly to if we had defined
;; these functions as pedestal defhandlers.  The main difference is that
;; the :body returned in the response should correlate to the protobuf
;; return-type declared in the Service definition within the .proto
;;
;; Note that our GRPC parameters are associated with the request-map
;; as :grpc-params, similar to how the pedestal body-param module
;; injects other types, like :json-params, :edn-params, etc.
